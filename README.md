# New-York-City-Taxi-Trip-Duration
Building a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City

**Business task:** determine the characteristics and use them to predict the duration of a taxi ride.

**A technical task for a specialist in Data Science:** build a machine learning model that, based on the proposed characteristics of the client, will predict a numerical feature - the time of a taxi ride. That is, to solve the regression problem.

**The main objectives of the project:**
1. To generate a dataset based on several sources of information
2. Design new features using Feature Engineering and identify the most significant ones when building a model
3. Examine the data provided and identify patterns
4. Build several models and choose the best one according to a given metric.
5. Design a process for predicting travel time for new data
