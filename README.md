Building a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City

**Business objective**: to segment existing customers, interpret these segments, and define a strategy for interacting with them.

**Technical task**: to build a customer clustering model based on their purchasing power, frequency of orders and the statute of limitations of the last purchase, to determine the profile of each cluster.

We will segment customers based on their purchasing power, the frequency of orders, and the statute of limitations of the last order, as well as determine the optimal strategy for interacting with them.

**The main objectives of the project**:
1. Perform preprocessing of the data set.
2. Conduct an intelligence analysis of the data and identify the main patterns.
3. Create product and customer categories. 
4. Build several machine learning models that solve the problem of clustering clients, determine the number of clusters and interpret them.
5. Design a process for predicting the category of customer interests and test your model on new customers.
